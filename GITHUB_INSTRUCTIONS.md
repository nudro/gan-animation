# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to upload your GAN Visualization project to GitHub:

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Enter "gan-animation" as the repository name
4. Add the description: "Conceptual GAN Training Visualization - An interactive 3D visualization of Generative Adversarial Network training dynamics"
5. Choose "Public" visibility
6. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license since we already have these files locally
7. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to push an existing repository. Follow these steps in your terminal:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /Users/catherineordun/Documents/AI_Coding/Adversarial_AI

# Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gan-animation.git

# Push your changes to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gan-animation`
2. You should see all your files uploaded including:
   - README.md
   - panda_gan_visualization.html
   - run.sh
   - panda.jpg
   - main.png

## Additional Notes

- If you need to update your Git configuration:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

- If you want to make changes to the repository after pushing:
  1. Make your changes locally
  2. Stage the changes: `git add .`
  3. Commit the changes: `git commit -m "Description of changes"`
  4. Push to GitHub: `git push`
